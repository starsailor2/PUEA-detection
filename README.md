# PUEA Detection

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to detect **Primary User Emulation Attacks (PUEA)** in wireless communication systems. PUEA occurs when attackers mimic legitimate primary users to disrupt spectrum-sharing environments. The model enhances spectrum security, ensuring fair and efficient use of licensed bands.

## Overview
PUEA detection is critical in **Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs)** and other spectrum-sharing systems. Attackers impersonate legitimate primary users, causing secondary users to vacate the spectrum. This project employs machine learning techniques to detect malicious signals and protect spectrum-sharing environments.

---

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Utilizes Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) for live monitoring.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Adapts to diverse environments, including urban and rural areas.
- **False Positive Mitigation**: Ensures high accuracy without unnecessary interruptions.

## Technical Approach
| Component           | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Collection** | Simulate PUEA scenarios using synthetic datasets or SDR-captured RF signals. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Extract time/frequency-domain features (e.g., cyclostationarity, energy levels). |
| **Model Training**  | Train classifiers (e.g., SVM, Random Forest) to distinguish legitimate vs. malicious signals. |
| **Evaluation**      | Measure detection accuracy, false-positive rates, and real-time performance. |

---

## Applications
This model has broad applications in the following domains:
1. **Telecommunications**: Protect spectrum leasing, IoT devices, and enable fraud detection.
2. **Public Safety**: Secure emergency response systems and critical infrastructure (e.g., power grids, transportation).
3. **Military & Defense**: Counteract spectrum spoofing and enhance battlefield communication security.
4. **Regulatory Compliance**: Automate spectrum auditing and enforce policy compliance.
