\section{Distance Matrix Calculation Using Manhattan Distance}
The foundation of clustering-based PUEA detection lies in accurately measuring the similarity between feature vectors representing different transmissions. The Manhattan distance metric is employed due to its robustness to outliers and computational efficiency in high-dimensional spaces.

\subsection{Manhattan Distance Formulation}
For two feature vectors $\vect{x}_i$ and $\vect{x}_j$ in a $d$-dimensional space, the Manhattan distance is defined as:

\begin{equation}
d_{Manhattan}(\vect{x}_i, \vect{x}_j) = \sum_{k=1}^{d} |x_{i,k} - x_{j,k}|
\end{equation}

where $x_{i,k}$ and $x_{j,k}$ represent the $k$-th components of vectors $\vect{x}_i$ and $\vect{x}_j$, respectively.

\subsection{Distance Matrix Construction}
The distance matrix $\mat{D}$ is constructed as an $N \times N$ symmetric matrix where:

\begin{equation}
\mat{D}_{i,j} = d_{Manhattan}(\vect{x}_i, \vect{x}_j)
\end{equation}

with properties:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mat{D}_{i,i} = 0$ (diagonal elements are zero)
\item $\mat{D}_{i,j} = \mat{D}_{j,i}$ (symmetry)
\item $\mat{D}_{i,j} \geq 0$ (non-negativity)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computational Optimization}
Several optimizations are implemented for efficient distance matrix calculation:

\subsubsection{Vectorized Computation}
The distance calculation is vectorized to leverage modern CPU architectures:
\begin{equation}
\mat{D} = \sum_{k=1}^{d} |\mat{X}_{:,k} \otimes \mathbf{1}^T - \mathbf{1} \otimes \mat{X}_{:,k}^T|
\end{equation}

where $\mat{X}$ is the feature matrix and $\otimes$ denotes the outer product.

\subsubsection{Sparse Matrix Representation}
For large datasets, sparse matrix representations are used when many distances exceed a threshold, reducing memory requirements.

\subsubsection{Approximation Techniques}
For real-time applications, distance approximation techniques are employed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Random sampling for approximate distance computation
\item Locality-sensitive hashing for nearest neighbor identification
\item Tree-based spatial indexing for efficient distance queries
\end{itemize}

\section{DBSCAN Clustering}
Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) is particularly well-suited for PUEA detection due to its ability to identify clusters of arbitrary shape and automatically detect outliers.

\subsection{DBSCAN Algorithm Principles}
DBSCAN operates based on two key parameters:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon$ (eps): The maximum distance between two points to be considered neighbors
\item $MinPts$: The minimum number of points required to form a dense region
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Core Concepts}
The algorithm defines three types of points:

\subsubsection{Core Points}
A point $p$ is a core point if it has at least $MinPts$ points within distance $\epsilon$:
\begin{equation}
|N_\epsilon(p)| \geq MinPts
\end{equation}

where $N_\epsilon(p) = \{q \in \mathcal{X} : d(p,q) \leq \epsilon\}$ is the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of $p$.

\subsubsection{Border Points}
A point $p$ is a border point if it is not a core point but lies within the $\epsilon$-neighborhood of a core point.

\subsubsection{Noise Points}
A point $p$ is a noise point if it is neither a core point nor a border point.

\subsection{DBSCAN Algorithm Implementation}
The DBSCAN algorithm for PUEA detection follows these steps:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{DBSCAN for PUEA Detection}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} Feature vectors $\mathcal{X}$, parameters $\epsilon$, $MinPts$
\State \textbf{Output:} Cluster assignments $C$
\State $C \leftarrow$ empty array of size $|\mathcal{X}|$
\State $ClusterId \leftarrow 0$
\For{each point $p \in \mathcal{X}$}
    \If{$C[p] \neq$ undefined}
        \State continue
    \EndIf
    \State $Neighbors \leftarrow$ getNeighbors($p$, $\epsilon$)
    \If{$|Neighbors| < MinPts$}
        \State $C[p] \leftarrow$ NOISE
    \Else
        \State $ClusterId \leftarrow ClusterId + 1$
        \State expandCluster($p$, $Neighbors$, $ClusterId$, $\epsilon$, $MinPts$)
    \EndIf
\EndFor
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Parameter Selection for PUEA Detection}
Parameter selection is crucial for optimal DBSCAN performance:

\subsubsection{Epsilon Selection}
The $\epsilon$ parameter is selected using the k-distance plot method:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Calculate the distance to the $k$-th nearest neighbor for each point
\item Sort these distances in ascending order
\item Plot the sorted distances
\item Identify the "elbow" point where the curve shows maximum curvature
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{MinPts Selection}
The $MinPts$ parameter is typically set based on:
\begin{itemize}
\item Dataset dimensionality: $MinPts \geq d + 1$
\item Expected cluster density
\item Noise tolerance requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsection{DBSCAN Advantages for PUEA Detection}
DBSCAN offers several advantages for PUEA detection:
\begin{itemize}
\item Automatic determination of cluster number
\item Robust identification of outliers (potential attackers)
\item Ability to handle clusters of varying shapes and densities
\item Resistance to noise in feature measurements
\end{itemize}

\section{K-Means Clustering}
K-means clustering provides a baseline comparison for PUEA detection performance, offering computational efficiency and simplicity of implementation.

\subsection{K-Means Algorithm Formulation}
K-means aims to minimize the within-cluster sum of squares:

\begin{equation}
J = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{\vect{x} \in C_i} ||\vect{x} - \vect{\mu}_i||^2
\end{equation}

where $C_i$ represents the $i$-th cluster and $\vect{\mu}_i$ is the centroid of cluster $C_i$.

\subsection{Algorithm Implementation}
The K-means algorithm for PUEA detection:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{K-Means for PUEA Detection}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} Feature vectors $\mathcal{X}$, number of clusters $k$
\State \textbf{Output:} Cluster assignments $C$, centroids $\{\vect{\mu}_1, \ldots, \vect{\mu}_k\}$
\State Initialize centroids $\{\vect{\mu}_1, \ldots, \vect{\mu}_k\}$ randomly
\Repeat
    \State \textbf{Assignment Step:}
    \For{each point $\vect{x}_i \in \mathcal{X}$}
        \State $C[i] \leftarrow \arg\min_{j} ||\vect{x}_i - \vect{\mu}_j||^2$
    \EndFor
    \State \textbf{Update Step:}
    \For{each cluster $j = 1, \ldots, k$}
        \State $\vect{\mu}_j \leftarrow \frac{1}{|C_j|} \sum_{\vect{x}_i \in C_j} \vect{x}_i$
    \EndFor
\Until{convergence}
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Initialization Strategies}
Several initialization strategies are evaluated:

\subsubsection{Random Initialization}
Random selection of initial centroids from the feature space:
\begin{equation}
\vect{\mu}_i^{(0)} \sim \mathcal{U}(\min(\mathcal{X}), \max(\mathcal{X}))
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{K-means++ Initialization}
Probabilistic selection that improves convergence:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose first centroid randomly from $\mathcal{X}$
\item For each subsequent centroid, choose point with probability proportional to squared distance from nearest existing centroid
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Forgy Initialization}
Random selection of initial centroids from actual data points:
\begin{equation}
\{\vect{\mu}_1^{(0)}, \ldots, \vect{\mu}_k^{(0)}\} \subset \mathcal{X}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Convergence Criteria}
Multiple convergence criteria are implemented:
\begin{itemize}
\item Centroid movement threshold: $||\vect{\mu}_i^{(t)} - \vect{\mu}_i^{(t-1)}|| < \epsilon$
\item Objective function change: $|J^{(t)} - J^{(t-1)}| < \delta$
\item Maximum iteration limit
\end{itemize}

\section{Hierarchical Clustering}
Hierarchical clustering provides insights into the multi-level structure of the data and offers flexibility in choosing the final number of clusters.

\subsection{Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm}
The agglomerative approach builds clusters bottom-up:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Agglomerative Clustering for PUEA Detection}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\State \textbf{Input:} Feature vectors $\mathcal{X}$, linkage criterion
\State \textbf{Output:} Hierarchical cluster structure
\State Initialize each point as its own cluster
\State Compute distance matrix $\mat{D}$
\While{number of clusters > 1}
    \State Find pair of clusters with minimum distance
    \State Merge the pair into a new cluster
    \State Update distance matrix
\EndWhile
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Linkage Criteria}
Several linkage criteria are evaluated for PUEA detection:

\subsubsection{Single Linkage}
Minimum distance between any two points in different clusters:
\begin{equation}
d_{single}(C_i, C_j) = \min_{\vect{x} \in C_i, \vect{y} \in C_j} d(\vect{x}, \vect{y})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Complete Linkage}
Maximum distance between any two points in different clusters:
\begin{equation}
d_{complete}(C_i, C_j) = \max_{\vect{x} \in C_i, \vect{y} \in C_j} d(\vect{x}, \vect{y})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Average Linkage}
Average distance between all pairs of points in different clusters:
\begin{equation}
d_{average}(C_i, C_j) = \frac{1}{|C_i||C_j|} \sum_{\vect{x} \in C_i} \sum_{\vect{y} \in C_j} d(\vect{x}, \vect{y})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Ward Linkage}
Minimizes the increase in within-cluster sum of squares:
\begin{equation}
d_{ward}(C_i, C_j) = \sqrt{\frac{2|C_i||C_j|}{|C_i|+|C_j|}} ||\vect{\mu}_i - \vect{\mu}_j||
\end{equation}

\subsection{Dendrogram Analysis}
The hierarchical clustering results are analyzed using dendrograms to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Visualize cluster formation process
\item Identify optimal number of clusters
\item Detect outliers and anomalous groupings
\item Understand data structure at multiple scales
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Cluster Number Selection}
Several methods determine the optimal number of clusters:

\subsubsection{Elbow Method}
Plot within-cluster sum of squares vs. number of clusters and identify the "elbow" point.

\subsubsection{Silhouette Analysis}
Calculate silhouette coefficient for different cluster numbers:
\begin{equation}
s(i) = \frac{b(i) - a(i)}{\max(a(i), b(i))}
\end{equation}

where $a(i)$ is the average distance to points in the same cluster and $b(i)$ is the average distance to points in the nearest neighboring cluster.

\subsubsection{Gap Statistic}
Compare within-cluster dispersion to expected dispersion under null reference distribution.

% CHAPTER 6: ENHANCED DETECTION APPROACH
% =============================================================================
\chapter{Enhanced Detection Approach}

\section{Motivation for Enhanced Detection}
While traditional clustering algorithms provide a solid foundation for PUEA detection, they exhibit limitations that motivate the development of enhanced approaches. These limitations become particularly apparent in dynamic wireless environments with sophisticated attack strategies.

\subsection{Limitations of Traditional Approaches}
Traditional clustering methods face several challenges in PUEA detection:

\subsubsection{Cluster Boundary Ambiguity}
Traditional algorithms often struggle with:
\begin{itemize}
\item Points lying near cluster boundaries
\item Overlapping cluster regions
\item Ambiguous cluster assignments for borderline cases
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Fixed Decision Boundaries}
Static cluster assignments cannot adapt to:
\begin{itemize}
\item Evolving attack strategies
\item Changing channel conditions
\item Time-varying network characteristics
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Limited Local Context Utilization}
Traditional methods often ignore:
\begin{itemize}
\item Local neighborhood structures
\item Fine-grained similarity relationships
\item Context-dependent classification decisions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Enhanced Detection Motivation}
The enhanced detection approach addresses these limitations by:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Incorporating local neighborhood analysis for refined decision making
\item Implementing adaptive mechanisms for dynamic environments
\item Utilizing multiple algorithmic perspectives for improved accuracy
\item Providing probabilistic confidence measures for detection decisions
\end{enumerate}

\section{KNN Algorithm within Clusters}
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is integrated within the clustering framework to provide refined classification decisions based on local neighborhood characteristics.

\subsection{Hybrid Clustering-KNN Framework}
The hybrid approach combines clustering and KNN in a two-stage process:

\subsubsection{Stage 1: Initial Clustering}
Traditional clustering algorithms partition the feature space into initial regions:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{X} = \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} C_i, \quad C_i \cap C_j = \emptyset \text{ for } i \neq j
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Stage 2: KNN Refinement}
Within each cluster, KNN analysis provides refined classification:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \text{majority\_vote}(\{y_j : \vect{x}_j \in \text{KNN}(\vect{x}_i, C_{cluster(\vect{x}_i)})\})
\end{equation}

\subsection{KNN Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{Distance-weighted Voting}
Instead of simple majority voting, distance-weighted voting provides more accurate classification:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \arg\max_{c} \sum_{j \in \text{KNN}(\vect{x}_i)} w_j \cdot \mathbf{1}(y_j = c)
\end{equation}

where the weight $w_j$ is inversely related to distance:
\begin{equation}
w_j = \frac{1}{d(\vect{x}_i, \vect{x}_j) + \epsilon}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Adaptive K Selection}
The value of $k$ in KNN is adaptively selected based on cluster characteristics:
\begin{equation}
k_{optimal} = \arg\min_{k} \text{CrossValidationError}(k, C_i)
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Local Density Consideration}
KNN analysis considers local density variations:
\begin{equation}
\rho_i = \frac{k}{V_k(\vect{x}_i)}
\end{equation}

where $V_k(\vect{x}_i)$ is the volume of the $k$-neighborhood around $\vect{x}_i$.

\subsection{Confidence Estimation}
The KNN framework provides confidence estimates for classification decisions:

\subsubsection{Voting Confidence}
Based on the distribution of votes among neighbors:
\begin{equation}
\text{confidence}_i = \frac{\max_c \sum_{j} w_j \cdot \mathbf{1}(y_j = c)}{\sum_{j} w_j}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Distance-based Confidence}
Based on the distance to nearest neighbors:
\begin{equation}
\text{confidence}_i = \exp\left(-\frac{1}{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k} d(\vect{x}_i, \vect{x}_{j}^{NN})\right)
\end{equation}

\section{Means Algorithm within Clusters}
The means algorithm within clusters provides an alternative approach to KNN, focusing on the relationship between data points and cluster centroids.

\subsection{Cluster-aware Means Classification}
The means algorithm classifies points based on their relationship to multiple cluster centroids:

\subsubsection{Multi-centroid Distance Analysis}
For each data point, distances to all cluster centroids are computed:
\begin{equation}
d_i^{(j)} = ||\vect{x}_i - \vect{\mu}_j||, \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots, k
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Relative Distance Scoring}
Classification is based on relative distances to different centroids:
\begin{equation}
\text{score}_i^{(c)} = \frac{\sum_{j \neq c} d_i^{(j)}}{\sum_{j=1}^{k} d_i^{(j)}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Probabilistic Classification}
Soft classification provides probabilistic cluster assignments:
\begin{equation}
P(C_j|\vect{x}_i) = \frac{\exp(-\beta \cdot d_i^{(j)})}{\sum_{l=1}^{k} \exp(-\beta \cdot d_i^{(l)})}
\end{equation}

where $\beta$ is a temperature parameter controlling classification sharpness.

\subsection{Enhanced Centroid Computation}
Traditional centroid computation is enhanced to improve discrimination:

\subsubsection{Weighted Centroids}
Centroids are computed using weighted averages:
\begin{equation}
\vect{\mu}_j^{weighted} = \frac{\sum_{i \in C_j} w_i \vect{x}_i}{\sum_{i \in C_j} w_i}
\end{equation}

where weights $w_i$ reflect point reliability or importance.

\subsubsection{Robust Centroids}
Robust centroid estimation reduces the impact of outliers:
\begin{equation}
\vect{\mu}_j^{robust} = \text{median}(\{\vect{x}_i : \vect{x}_i \in C_j\})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Adaptive Centroids}
Centroids adapt based on local data characteristics:
\begin{equation}
\vect{\mu}_j^{adaptive} = \alpha \vect{\mu}_j^{traditional} + (1-\alpha) \vect{\mu}_j^{local}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Decision Fusion}
Multiple means-based classifications are fused for improved decisions:

\subsubsection{Ensemble Voting}
Multiple means algorithms with different parameters vote on classification:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \text{majority\_vote}(\{\hat{y}_i^{(1)}, \hat{y}_i^{(2)}, \ldots, \hat{y}_i^{(M)}\})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Confidence-weighted Fusion}
Decisions are weighted by algorithm confidence:
\begin{equation}
\hat{y}_i = \arg\max_c \sum_{m=1}^{M} \text{confidence}_m(\vect{x}_i) \cdot \mathbf{1}(\hat{y}_i^{(m)} = c)
\end{equation}

\section{Comparative Analysis with Traditional Methods}

\begin{itemize}
\item 20-30% reduction in false positive rates

While enhanced methods introduce computational overhead:
\begin{itemize}
\item 15-25% increase in computation time
\item Scalable implementation for real-time applications
\item Acceptable trade-off between accuracy and complexity
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scenario-specific Performance}
