\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

\section{Summary of Research}

This thesis has investigated the detection of Primary User Emulation Attacks (PUEA) in cognitive radio networks, with a particular focus on comparing traditional clustering algorithms with an enhanced, two-stage detection approach. The research systematically evaluated both approaches across varying scenarios of spatial proximity between legitimate and malicious transmitters, different attack intensities, and diverse network conditions.

The traditional clustering algorithms examined—DBSCAN, K-means, Agglomerative, and Spectral clustering—demonstrated reasonable effectiveness in distinguishing between legitimate Primary User (PU) signals and PUEA signals, particularly in scenarios where spatial separation was significant. Each algorithm exhibited distinct strengths: DBSCAN provided robust noise handling, K-means offered computational efficiency, Agglomerative clustering demonstrated flexibility through hierarchical organization, and Spectral clustering excelled in complex feature spaces.

The enhanced detection approach, which combined traditional clustering with KNN or Means algorithms applied within the resulting clusters, consistently outperformed the traditional methods across all experimental conditions. This improvement was particularly pronounced in challenging scenarios where the PUEA transmitter was spatially close to the legitimate PU, with performance gains of up to 14.2\% in detection rate and 12.5\% in F1-score.

Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements, with p-values well below the standard significance threshold of 0.05 for paired t-tests comparing traditional and enhanced methods. The results demonstrated that the two-stage approach effectively leverages both global patterns (through initial clustering) and local relationships (through the refinement stage), creating a more robust detection framework capable of identifying subtle differences between legitimate and malicious signals.

    \item \textbf{Feature Engineering:} Identified and quantified the most effective signal features for distinguishing between legitimate and malicious transmissions, including statistical moments, signal envelope characteristics, and spectral properties.

    \item \textbf{Scenario Analysis:} Provided detailed insights into how spatial proximity between PU and PUEA affects detection performance and which techniques are most resilient to this proximity challenge.

These contributions collectively advance the state-of-the-art in PUEA detection, providing both theoretical insights and practical tools for securing cognitive radio networks against this sophisticated form of attack.

\section{Limitations of the Study}

While this research has yielded significant insights and advancements, several limitations should be acknowledged:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simulation-Based Evaluation:} The results are based on simulated data rather than measurements from real-world cognitive radio networks, which may not capture all complexities of practical deployment environments.

    \item \textbf{Static Attack Model:} The research assumed a relatively static PUEA strategy rather than adaptive attackers that might modify their behavior in response to detection mechanisms.

    \item \textbf{Computational Complexity:} The enhanced approach, while more accurate, introduces additional computational overhead that may be challenging for resource-constrained cognitive radio devices.

    \item \textbf{Network Scale:} The simulations were conducted at a moderate network scale, and performance at very large scales remains to be fully validated.

    \item \textbf{Feature Selection:} While comprehensive, the feature set used may not exhaustively represent all potentially useful signal characteristics for detection.
    
    \item \textbf{Channel Model Limitations:} The propagation models, while realistic, cannot fully capture all environmental factors that might influence signal characteristics in diverse deployment settings.
\end{itemize}

These limitations present opportunities for future research to build upon and extend the findings presented in this thesis.

\section{Final Remarks}

Primary User Emulation Attacks represent a significant security challenge for cognitive radio networks, threatening the foundational premise of dynamic spectrum sharing. This research has demonstrated that while traditional clustering approaches provide a viable foundation for detection, significant performance improvements can be achieved through the proposed enhanced detection methodology that combines global and local pattern analysis.

The persistent challenge of detecting PUEA in close-proximity scenarios highlights the need for continued research and innovation in this field. As cognitive radio technologies become more prevalent in addressing spectrum scarcity challenges, securing these networks against sophisticated attacks like PUEA becomes increasingly critical to their successful deployment and operation.

The findings presented in this thesis not only advance our understanding of PUEA detection but also establish a foundation for future research that can further enhance security in cognitive radio networks. By continuing to develop more sophisticated detection techniques while addressing practical implementation challenges, researchers and engineers can work toward creating cognitive radio networks that deliver on their promise of efficient spectrum utilization while maintaining robust security against malicious exploitation.
