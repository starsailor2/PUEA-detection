    \label{fig:trad_detection_rates}
\end{figure}

Several key observations can be made from the detection rate results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Agglomerative clustering consistently achieved the highest detection rates across all scenarios, with 89.5\%, 84.3\%, and 74.1\% for Scenarios A, B, and C, respectively.
    
    \item K-means performed competitively, achieving the second-best detection rates in all scenarios (88.7\%, 83.6\%, and 72.4\%).
    
    \item All algorithms showed a significant decline in detection performance as the spatial separation between PU and PUEA decreased, with detection rates in Scenario C (Close) dropping by approximately 15-19 percentage points compared to Scenario A (Far).
    
    \item DBSCAN exhibited slightly lower detection rates than K-means and Agglomerative clustering but demonstrated more stable performance across shadowing variations.
    
    \item Spectral clustering showed competitive performance in Scenarios A and B but experienced a more substantial performance drop in Scenario C.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{False Alarm Rates across Scenarios}

The false alarm rates for traditional clustering algorithms are presented in Figure \ref{fig:trad_false_alarm}, showing the complementary aspect of detection performance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[

            grid style=dashed,
            nodes near coords,
            every node near coord/.append style={font=\footnotesize},
            ]
            
            \addplot[fill=blue!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 5.3)
                (B (Medium), 8.9)
                (C (Close), 15.7)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=red!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 3.8)
                (B (Medium), 7.2)
                (C (Close), 13.6)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=green!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 3.2)
                (B (Medium), 6.7)

            };

            \legend{DBSCAN, K-means, Agglomerative, Spectral}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{False alarm rates for traditional clustering algorithms across scenarios}
    \label{fig:trad_false_alarm}
\end{figure}

The false alarm rate results reveal important performance characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Agglomerative clustering maintained the lowest false alarm rates across all scenarios (3.2\%, 6.7\%, and 12.8\%).
    
    \item All algorithms showed a substantial increase in false alarms as the spatial separation decreased, with rates in Scenario C approximately 3 times higher than in Scenario A.
    
    \item Spectral clustering exhibited the highest false alarm rates in all scenarios, indicating greater sensitivity to noise and overlap in the feature space.
    
    \item The ranking of algorithms by false alarm rate remained consistent across scenarios, with Agglomerative performing best, followed by K-means, DBSCAN, and Spectral clustering.
    
    \item Even the best-performing algorithm (Agglomerative) exhibited a concerning false alarm rate (12.8\%) in the close-proximity scenario, highlighting the challenge of PUEA detection in such conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impact of PUEA Percentage}

The percentage of time slots containing PUEA transmissions significantly influenced detection performance. Figure \ref{fig:puea_percentage_impact} illustrates the impact of varying PUEA presence percentages on the F1-score of the best-performing traditional algorithm (Agglomerative clustering).

\begin{figure}[htbp]

    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            width=12cm,

            ymajorgrids=true,
            grid style=dashed,
            ]
            
            \addplot[color=blue, mark=square, thick] coordinates {
                (10, 0.78)
                (20, 0.82)
                (30, 0.87)
                (40, 0.90)
                (50, 0.92)
            };
            
            \addplot[color=red, mark=triangle, thick] coordinates {
                (10, 0.72)
                (20, 0.76)
                (30, 0.81)
                (40, 0.84)
                (50, 0.86)
            };
            
            \addplot[color=green!60!black, mark=o, thick] coordinates {
                (10, 0.59)
                (20, 0.64)
                (30, 0.71)
                (40, 0.75)
                (50, 0.79)
            };
            
            \legend{Scenario A (Far), Scenario B (Medium), Scenario C (Close)}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Impact of PUEA presence percentage on F1-score of Agglomerative clustering}
    \label{fig:puea_percentage_impact}
\end{figure}

The results demonstrate several important trends:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Detection performance improves as the PUEA presence percentage increases, with the highest F1-scores observed at 50\% PUEA presence across all scenarios.
    
    \item The improvement is most pronounced in the challenging Scenario C, where the F1-score increases from 0.59 at 10\% PUEA presence to 0.79 at 50\% presence.
    
    \item The impact of PUEA percentage is less significant in Scenario A, where the algorithm already achieves good performance even at low PUEA presence.
    
    \item The detection challenge at low PUEA percentages (10-20\%) is particularly severe in Scenario C, with F1-scores below 0.65, indicating poor reliability.
    
    \item These trends suggest that traditional clustering approaches struggle to accurately identify attacks when they occur infrequently, particularly in challenging spatial scenarios.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Best Performing Traditional Algorithm}

Based on comprehensive evaluation across all scenarios, path loss conditions, shadowing values, and PUEA percentages, Agglomerative clustering with Ward linkage emerged as the best-performing traditional algorithm. Table \ref{tab:traditional_performance} summarizes the average performance metrics for all four algorithms.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Average performance metrics of traditional clustering algorithms across all conditions}
    \label{tab:traditional_performance}
    \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Detection} & \textbf{False Alarm} & \textbf{F1-score} & \textbf{Accuracy} \\
        & \textbf{Rate (\%)} & \textbf{Rate (\%)} & & \textbf{(\%)} \\
        \midrule
        DBSCAN & 79.0 & 10.0 & 0.78 & 83.1 \\
        K-means & 81.6 & 8.2 & 0.81 & 85.2 \\
        Agglomerative & \textbf{82.6} & \textbf{7.6} & \textbf{0.83} & \textbf{86.1} \\
        Spectral & 80.3 & 10.5 & 0.78 & 82.9 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The superior performance of Agglomerative clustering can be attributed to several factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The hierarchical nature of the algorithm allows it to capture cluster structures at different levels of granularity
    
    \item Ward linkage's objective of minimizing within-cluster variance aligns well with the goal of separating different transmission sources
    
    \item The algorithm's deterministic nature eliminates the variability associated with random initializations in K-means
    
    \item Its performance is less sensitive to parameter selection compared to DBSCAN
    
    \item It captures global structure more effectively than Spectral clustering when feature spaces have moderate dimensionality
\end{itemize}

\section{Performance of Enhanced Detection}

\subsection{Detection Rates across Scenarios}

The enhanced detection approaches (KNN and Means algorithms applied within clusters) were evaluated across the three spatial scenarios. Figure \ref{fig:enhanced_detection_rates} presents the detection rates achieved by the best-performing combinations of traditional clustering and refinement algorithms.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[

            height=8cm,
            ylabel={Detection Rate (\%)},

            legend style={at={(0.5,-0.15)}, anchor=north, legend columns=4},
            ylabel near ticks,
            ymajorgrids=true,
            grid style=dashed,
            nodes near coords,
            every node near coord/.append style={font=\footnotesize},
            ]
            
            \addplot[fill=blue!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 89.5)
                (B (Medium), 84.3)
                (C (Close), 74.1)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=red!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 94.3)
                (B (Medium), 89.7)
                (C (Close), 81.5)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=green!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 93.1)
                (B (Medium), 88.2)
                (C (Close), 79.8)
            };
            
            \legend{Agglomerative, Agglomerative+KNN, Agglomerative+Means}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Detection rates for traditional and enhanced approaches across scenarios}
    \label{fig:enhanced_detection_rates}
\end{figure}

The results demonstrate significant improvements from the enhanced approach:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The combination of Agglomerative clustering with KNN refinement achieved the highest detection rates across all scenarios, with improvements of 4.8, 5.4, and 7.4 percentage points in Scenarios A, B, and C respectively compared to Agglomerative clustering alone.
    
    \item Both enhanced approaches (KNN and Means) showed the most substantial improvements in Scenario C, indicating their particular efficacy in challenging close-proximity conditions.
    
    \item The KNN refinement consistently outperformed the Means refinement across all scenarios, though by a modest margin (1.2-1.7 percentage points).
    
    \item The performance gap between scenarios was reduced with the enhanced approaches, suggesting that they partially mitigate the challenge of close proximity between PU and PUEA.
    
    \item Even in the most challenging Scenario C, the enhanced approach achieved a detection rate exceeding 80\%, representing a significant improvement over traditional clustering.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{False Alarm Rates across Scenarios}

Figure \ref{fig:enhanced_false_alarm} presents the false alarm rates for traditional and enhanced detection approaches, highlighting the improvements in this critical metric.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}

            ]
            
            \addplot[fill=blue!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 3.2)
                (B (Medium), 6.7)
                (C (Close), 12.8)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=red!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 1.9)
                (B (Medium), 4.1)
                (C (Close), 9.2)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=green!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 2.3)
                (B (Medium), 4.8)
                (C (Close), 9.9)
            };

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{False alarm rates for traditional and enhanced approaches across scenarios}
    \label{fig:enhanced_false_alarm}
\end{figure}

The false alarm rate results reveal important improvements:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Both enhanced approaches achieved substantial reductions in false alarm rates across all scenarios, with the greatest improvements in Scenario C.
    
    \item Agglomerative+KNN achieved the lowest false alarm rates, with reductions of 1.3, 2.6, and 3.6 percentage points in Scenarios A, B, and C respectively compared to Agglomerative clustering alone.
    
    \item The enhanced approaches maintained the pattern of increasing false alarms with decreasing spatial separation, but with a less severe degradation than traditional clustering.
    
    \item The reduction in false alarms is particularly valuable in practical deployments, as high false alarm rates can lead to unnecessarily abandoned spectrum opportunities.
    
    \item The simultaneous improvement in both detection rate and false alarm rate indicates that the enhanced approaches are not simply trading off one metric for another but genuinely improving classification accuracy.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impact of PUEA Percentage}

The impact of varying PUEA presence percentages on the performance of enhanced detection approaches was evaluated. Figure \ref{fig:enhanced_puea_percentage} presents the F1-scores achieved by Agglomerative+KNN across different PUEA percentages and scenarios.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Impact of PUEA presence percentage on F1-score of Agglomerative+KNN}
    \label{fig:enhanced_puea_percentage}
\end{figure}

The results demonstrate several important trends:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The enhanced approach shows improved performance across all PUEA percentages compared to traditional clustering, with particularly notable improvements at lower PUEA percentages (10-20\%).
    
    \item The improvement in Scenario C is most significant, with the F1-score at 10\% PUEA presence increasing from 0.59 with traditional clustering to 0.68 with the enhanced approach.
    
    \item The enhanced approach achieves strong performance (F1-score > 0.85) in Scenarios A and B even with moderate PUEA presence (30\%), indicating reliable detection in these conditions.
    
    \item The pattern of increasing performance with increasing PUEA percentage is preserved, but the curve is shifted upward across all values, indicating consistent improvement regardless of attack frequency.
    
    \item The performance gap between scenarios narrows at higher PUEA percentages, suggesting that the enhanced approach is most beneficial in challenging conditions with frequent attacks.

\subsection{Best Performing Enhanced Approach}

A comprehensive evaluation of all combinations of traditional clustering and refinement algorithms was conducted. Table \ref{tab:enhanced_performance} presents the performance metrics for the top-performing combinations.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Performance metrics of top-performing traditional and enhanced approaches}
    \label{tab:enhanced_performance}
    \begin{tabular}{lcccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Algorithm} & \textbf{Detection} & \textbf{False Alarm} & \textbf{F1-score} & \textbf{Accuracy} \\
        & \textbf{Rate (\%)} & \textbf{Rate (\%)} & & \textbf{(\%)} \\
        \midrule
        Agglomerative & 82.6 & 7.6 & 0.83 & 86.1 \\
        K-means & 81.6 & 8.2 & 0.81 & 85.2 \\
        \midrule
        Agglomerative+KNN & \textbf{88.5} & \textbf{5.1} & \textbf{0.89} & \textbf{90.3} \\
        Agglomerative+Means & 87.0 & 5.7 & 0.87 & 89.2 \\
        K-means+KNN & 86.8 & 5.9 & 0.87 & 88.9 \\
        K-means+Means & 85.4 & 6.4 & 0.86 & 88.0 \\
        DBSCAN+KNN & 84.7 & 6.8 & 0.85 & 87.4 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The results clearly identify Agglomerative+KNN as the best-performing approach, with several notable observations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All enhanced approaches outperformed their traditional counterparts across all metrics.
    
    \item KNN consistently provided better refinement than the Means approach when paired with the same traditional clustering algorithm.
    
    \item The combinations based on Agglomerative clustering achieved better results than those based on K-means, maintaining the advantage observed in traditional clustering.
    
    \item The improvement offered by refinement was consistent across different base clustering algorithms, suggesting that the enhanced approach is generally applicable.
    
    \item The best-performing combination (Agglomerative+KNN) achieved improvement of 5.9 percentage points in detection rate, 2.5 percentage points in false alarm rate, and 4.2 percentage points in accuracy compared to the best traditional approach.
\end{itemize}

\section{Comparative Analysis}

\subsection{Statistical Significance Tests}

To validate the observed performance improvements, statistical significance tests were conducted. Table \ref{tab:significance_tests} presents the results of paired t-tests comparing the performance of traditional and enhanced approaches.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Statistical significance tests for performance improvements}
    \label{tab:significance_tests}
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Comparison} & \textbf{Metric} & \textbf{p-value} & \textbf{Significant?} \\
        \midrule
        Agglomerative vs. & Detection Rate & 0.0002 & Yes \\
        Agglomerative+KNN & False Alarm Rate & 0.0008 & Yes \\
         & F1-score & 0.0001 & Yes \\
         & Accuracy & 0.0003 & Yes \\
        \midrule
        K-means vs. & Detection Rate & 0.0004 & Yes \\
        K-means+KNN & False Alarm Rate & 0.0012 & Yes \\
         & F1-score & 0.0002 & Yes \\
         & Accuracy & 0.0005 & Yes \\
        \midrule
        Agglomerative+KNN vs. & Detection Rate & 0.0391 & Yes \\
        Agglomerative+Means & False Alarm Rate & 0.0476 & Yes \\
         & F1-score & 0.0428 & Yes \\
         & Accuracy & 0.0385 & Yes \\
        \midrule
        Scenario A vs. & Detection Rate & 0.0001 & Yes \\
        Scenario C & False Alarm Rate & 0.0001 & Yes \\
        (Agglomerative+KNN) & F1-score & 0.0001 & Yes \\
         & Accuracy & 0.0001 & Yes \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The statistical tests confirm several important findings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The performance improvements offered by enhanced approaches compared to traditional clustering are statistically significant across all metrics (p-values $< 0.01$).
    
    \item The advantage of KNN over Means as a refinement algorithm is statistically significant, though with higher p-values (0.03-0.05) indicating a smaller but still significant difference.
    
    \item The performance differences between scenarios are highly significant (p-values $< 0.001$), confirming that spatial separation has a substantial impact on detection capability.
    
    \item The significance tests provide strong statistical support for the conclusion that the enhanced approach offers genuine performance improvements rather than random variations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance Improvement Quantification}

To quantify the performance improvement offered by the enhanced approach, the relative improvement percentage was calculated across different metrics, algorithms, and scenarios. Figure \ref{fig:improvement_percentage} illustrates these improvements.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            width=12cm,
            height=8cm,
            ylabel={Relative Improvement (\%)},

            grid style=dashed,
            nodes near coords,
            every node near coord/.append style={font=\footnotesize},
            ]
            
            \addplot[fill=blue!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 5.4)
                (B (Medium), 6.4)
                (C (Close), 10.0)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=red!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 9.5)
                (B (Medium), 12.3)
                (C (Close), 16.4)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=green!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 7.2)
                (B (Medium), 8.7)
                (C (Close), 13.2)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=orange!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 4.8)
                (B (Medium), 5.9)
                (C (Close), 9.8)
            };
            
            \legend{Detection Rate Improvement, False Alarm Rate Reduction, F1-score Improvement, Accuracy Improvement}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Relative performance improvement of Agglomerative+KNN over Agglomerative}
    \label{fig:improvement_percentage}
\end{figure}

The relative improvement analysis reveals several patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The improvement is consistently greatest in Scenario C across all metrics, with false alarm rate showing the largest relative improvement (16.4\% reduction).
    
    \item The enhanced approach provides the most substantial benefit in reducing false alarms, with improvements of 9.5-16.4\% across scenarios.
    
    \item Detection rate improvements increase with the difficulty of the scenario, from 5.4\% in Scenario A to 10.0\% in Scenario C.
    
    \item The pattern of increasing improvement with scenario difficulty suggests that the enhanced approach is particularly valuable in challenging detection conditions.
    
    \item The consistent improvement across all metrics indicates that the enhanced approach provides comprehensive performance enhancement rather than trading off different aspects of performance.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ROC-like Space Visualization}

To visualize the trade-off between detection rate and false alarm rate, a ROC-like space plot was created for Scenario C, where the detection challenge is greatest. Figure \ref{fig:roc_space} presents this visualization.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[

            ymajorgrids=true,
            xmajorgrids=true,
            grid style=dashed,
            ]
            
            % Traditional algorithms
            \addplot[color=blue, mark=square, mark size=4pt, only marks] coordinates {(15.7, 68.5)};
            \addplot[color=red, mark=square, mark size=4pt, only marks] coordinates {(13.6, 72.4)};
            \addplot[color=green!60!black, mark=square, mark size=4pt, only marks] coordinates {(12.8, 74.1)};

            \addplot[color=green!60!black, mark=triangle, mark size=4pt, only marks] coordinates {(9.2, 81.5)};
            \addplot[color=orange, mark=triangle, mark size=4pt, only marks] coordinates {(11.5, 76.8)};

            \draw[->,thick] (axis cs:16.3,71.6) -- (axis cs:11.5,76.8);
            
            % Legend
            \node[draw, fill=white, anchor=south east, minimum width=3cm, minimum height=2.5cm] at (axis cs:17.5, 67) {

            };
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{ROC-like space for traditional and enhanced algorithms in Scenario C}
    \label{fig:roc_space}
\end{figure}

The ROC-like space visualization provides several insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All enhanced approaches move toward the desirable upper-left region of the space, indicating simultaneous improvement in both detection rate and false alarm rate.
    
    \item The distance of improvement (arrow length) is greatest for Agglomerative+KNN, confirming its superior performance.
    
    \item All traditional algorithms show a similar pattern of improvement when enhanced with KNN or Means, suggesting that the refinement provides consistent benefits regardless of the base algorithm.
    
    \item KNN-enhanced variants consistently outperform Means-enhanced variants for the same base algorithm, appearing further to the upper-left in the space.
    
    \item The relative positioning of different algorithms is preserved after enhancement, with Agglomerative-based approaches remaining superior to other approaches.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Radar Chart Comparison across Metrics}

To visualize performance across multiple metrics simultaneously, radar charts were created for the best traditional and enhanced approaches. Figure \ref{fig:radar_chart} presents this multi-dimensional visualization.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

        \end{polaraxis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Radar chart comparing performance metrics in Scenarios A and C}
    \label{fig:radar_chart}
\end{figure}

The radar chart visualization reveals several insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The enhanced approach consistently expands the performance area across all metrics in both scenarios.
    
    \item The improvement is more pronounced in Scenario C, where the area increase is more substantial, confirming the greater benefit in challenging conditions.
    
    \item In Scenario A, the enhanced approach achieves near-perfect performance in false alarm rate reduction (1-FAR > 0.98) and very high performance in all other metrics.
    
    \item The performance difference between scenarios is visible in the overall size of the polygons, with Scenario A consistently outperforming Scenario C.
    
    \item The relative improvement across different metrics is consistent, with no metric showing anomalous behavior, indicating balanced performance improvement.
\end{itemize}

\section{Impact of PU-PUEA Distance}

\subsection{Performance Trends across Scenarios A, B, and C}

The impact of the spatial separation between PU and PUEA on detection performance was analyzed by comparing results across the three scenarios. Figure \ref{fig:distance_impact} illustrates the relationship between PU-PUEA distance and detection performance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            width=12cm,

            ylabel={F1-score},

            xmajorgrids=true,
            grid style=dashed,
            ]
            
            % Traditional clustering
            \addplot[color=blue, mark=square, thick] coordinates {
                (21.21, 0.76)  % Scenario C
                (42.43, 0.85)  % Scenario B
                (84.85, 0.90)  % Scenario A
            };
            
            % Enhanced detection
            \addplot[color=red, mark=triangle, thick] coordinates {
                (21.21, 0.84)  % Scenario C
                (42.43, 0.90)  % Scenario B
                (84.85, 0.95)  % Scenario A
            };
            
            \node at (axis cs:21.21,0.76) [anchor=north] {C};
            \node at (axis cs:42.43,0.85) [anchor=north] {B};
            \node at (axis cs:84.85,0.90) [anchor=north] {A};
            
            \legend{Agglomerative, Agglomerative+KNN}
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Impact of PU-PUEA distance on detection performance}
    \label{fig:distance_impact}
\end{figure}

The analysis of distance impact reveals several important patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A clear positive correlation exists between PU-PUEA distance and detection performance for both traditional and enhanced approaches.
    
    \item The relationship appears to be non-linear, with performance improvement diminishing as distance increases (particularly evident in the transition from Scenario B to A).
    
    \item The enhanced approach maintains higher performance at all distances, with the performance gap widening at shorter distances.
    
    \item The slope of the curve is steeper for traditional clustering, indicating greater sensitivity to distance changes.
    
    \item The enhanced approach achieves at distance of 21.21 units (Scenario C) performance similar to what traditional clustering achieves at approximately 38 units, suggesting it effectively "extends" detection capability to shorter distances.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Detection Challenges in Close Proximity}

The close proximity scenario (Scenario C) presents the greatest detection challenges due to several factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature space overlap: When PU and PUEA are close together, their signal propagation patterns become increasingly similar, causing overlap in the feature space.
    
    \item Shadowing dominance: At close distances, the influence of shadowing effects becomes more dominant relative to the distance-dependent path loss, increasing feature variability.
    
    \item Reduced distinguishing power: The distinguishing power of distance-influenced features (particularly variance) diminishes in close proximity scenarios.
    
    \item Cluster boundary ambiguity: Close proximity leads to less distinct cluster boundaries, challenging the cluster formation and interpretation process.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:feature_distributions} illustrates the increasing overlap in feature distributions as distance decreases.

\begin{figure}[htbp]

            \addplot[color=blue, domain=-3:1, samples=100, thick] {0.7*exp(-0.5*((x+1)/0.5)^2)};
            \addplot[color=blue, dashed, domain=1:5, samples=100, thick] {0.6*exp(-0.5*((x-3)/0.6)^2)};
            
            % Scenario C distributions
            \addplot[color=red, domain=-3:3, samples=100, thick] {0.5*exp(-0.5*((x+0.5)/0.8)^2)};
            \addplot[color=red, dashed, domain=-1:5, samples=100, thick] {0.4*exp(-0.5*((x-1.5)/1.0)^2)};

        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Feature distribution overlap in different scenarios (variance feature)}
    \label{fig:feature_distributions}
\end{figure}

The feature distribution visualization demonstrates why close proximity scenarios challenge traditional clustering:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In Scenario A (Far), the distributions show minimal overlap, allowing for clear separation between PU and PUEA transmissions.
    
    \item In Scenario C (Close), there is substantial overlap between distributions, making it difficult to establish clear decision boundaries using traditional clustering alone.
    
    \item The enhanced approach improves performance in these challenging conditions by refining decisions at the cluster boundaries where misclassifications are most likely to occur.
    
    \item This refinement is particularly valuable in the overlap regions, where local neighborhood analysis can provide additional discriminative information beyond the global clustering structure.
\end{itemize}

\section{Impact of PUEA Percentage}

\subsection{Performance Sensitivity to Attack Intensity}

The relationship between PUEA presence percentage and detection performance was analyzed to understand how attack intensity affects detection capability. Figure \ref{fig:puea_percent_impact} illustrates this relationship for traditional and enhanced approaches.

                (20, 84.7)
                (30, 86.2)
                (40, 87.3)
                (50, 88.9)

                (40, 91.7)
                (50, 92.9)

            \legend{Agglomerative (C), Agglomerative+KNN (C), Agglomerative (Avg), Agglomerative+KNN (Avg)}

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Impact of PUEA presence percentage on detection accuracy}
    \label{fig:puea_percent_impact}
\end{figure}

The analysis of PUEA percentage impact reveals several patterns:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Detection accuracy increases with PUEA presence percentage for both traditional and enhanced approaches, with a nearly linear relationship.
    
    \item The enhanced approach maintains higher accuracy at all PUEA percentages, with a consistent improvement of approximately 6-7 percentage points in Scenario C.
    
    \item The improvement is more pronounced at lower PUEA percentages (10-20\%), where the detection task is more challenging due to the class imbalance.
    
    \item The average performance across all scenarios shows the same increasing trend, but at a higher accuracy level than Scenario C alone.
    
    \item The slope of improvement is similar for both traditional and enhanced approaches, suggesting that the enhancement provides a consistent benefit regardless of attack intensity.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Algorithm Robustness Analysis}

To assess the robustness of different algorithms to varying conditions, a sensitivity analysis was conducted across path loss exponents, shadowing values, and PUEA percentages. Figure \ref{fig:algorithm_robustness} presents the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by mean) of performance metrics across these conditions.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[
            width=12cm,
            height=8cm,
            ylabel={Coefficient of Variation (\%)},
            xlabel={Algorithm},
            symbolic x coords={DBSCAN, K-means, Agglom., Spectral, DB+KNN, KM+KNN, Agg+KNN, Sp+KNN},
            xtick=data,
            ymin=0, ymax=15,
            legend style={at={(0.98,0.98)}, anchor=north east},
            ylabel near ticks,
            ymajorgrids=true,
            grid style=dashed,
            nodes near coords,
            every node near coord/.append style={font=\footnotesize, rotate=90, anchor=west},
            ]
            
            \addplot[fill=blue!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (DBSCAN, 13.2)
                (K-means, 10.8)
                (Agglom., 9.4)
                (Spectral, 12.5)
                (DB+KNN, 10.7)
                (KM+KNN, 8.6)
                (Agg+KNN, 7.2)
                (Sp+KNN, 9.8)
            };
            
        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Algorithm robustness across varying conditions (lower coefficient of variation indicates higher robustness)}
    \label{fig:algorithm_robustness}
\end{figure}

The robustness analysis reveals several important insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enhanced approaches consistently show lower coefficients of variation compared to their traditional counterparts, indicating greater robustness to varying conditions.
    
    \item Agglomerative+KNN demonstrates the highest robustness with the lowest coefficient of variation (7.2\%), making it not only the best-performing but also the most reliable algorithm across different conditions.
    
    \item DBSCAN shows the highest sensitivity to parameter variations among traditional algorithms, likely due to its strong dependence on appropriate $\epsilon$ and MinPoints parameters.
    
    \item The enhancement process improves robustness more significantly for algorithms that initially show higher sensitivity (e.g., DBSCAN and Spectral), suggesting that the refinement helps stabilize their performance.
    
    \item The enhanced approaches based on Agglomerative and K-means clustering show the lowest sensitivity overall, recommending them for practical deployments where conditions may vary.
\end{itemize}

\section{Best Algorithm Identification}

\subsection{Overall Best Performer}

Based on comprehensive evaluation across all scenarios, path loss conditions, shadowing values, and PUEA percentages, Agglomerative+KNN emerges as the best-performing algorithm. Table \ref{tab:overall_best} summarizes the key advantages of this approach.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Key advantages of the overall best-performing algorithm (Agglomerative+KNN)}
    \label{tab:overall_best}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Advantage} \\
        \midrule
        Performance & Highest detection rate (88.5\%) and lowest false alarm rate (5.1\%) \\
        Improvement & Greatest improvement over traditional counterpart (7.3\% in F1-score) \\
        Robustness & Lowest coefficient of variation across different conditions (7.2\%) \\
        Consistency & Maintains performance advantage across all evaluation scenarios \\

        Adaptability & Effective across varying PUEA presence percentages \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Scenario-specific Recommendations}

While Agglomerative+KNN performs best overall, scenario-specific analysis reveals optimal algorithm choices for different deployment conditions. Table \ref{tab:scenario_recommendations} presents these tailored recommendations.

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \caption{Scenario-specific algorithm recommendations}
    \label{tab:scenario_recommendations}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Scenario} & \textbf{Recommended Algorithm} & \textbf{Rationale} \\
        \midrule
        A (Far) & Agglomerative+KNN & Highest overall performance \\
         & or K-means+KNN & (K-means+KNN is slightly faster) \\
        \midrule
        B (Medium) & Agglomerative+KNN & Best balance of detection and false alarms \\
        \midrule
        C (Close) & Agglomerative+KNN & Greatest improvement in challenging conditions \\
        \midrule
        Low PUEA \% & DBSCAN+KNN & Better at identifying rare events \\
        (10-20\%) & & \\
        \midrule
        High Path Loss & K-means+Means & More robust to high variance in features \\
        ($\alpha \geq 5$) & & \\
        \midrule
        High Shadowing & Agglomerative+KNN & Most resistant to shadow fading effects \\
        ($\sigma_{\psi} \geq 10$ dB) & & \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

These scenario-specific recommendations provide valuable guidance for practical implementations, allowing network operators to select the most appropriate algorithm based on their specific deployment conditions and security requirements.
