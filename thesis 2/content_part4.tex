\chapter{Experimental Setup}

\section{\texorpdfstring{\large\textbf{Simulation Environment Details}}{Simulation Environment Details}}

The experimental evaluation of PUEA detection algorithms was conducted in a carefully designed simulation environment that models the cognitive radio network and attack scenarios. The simulation framework was implemented in MATLAB R2021b, chosen for its robust signal processing capabilities, matrix operations efficiency, and visualization tools. All experiments were executed on a workstation with an Intel Core i9-11900K processor, 64GB RAM, and Windows 10 operating system.

\subsection{Simulation Framework Architecture}

The simulation framework consists of four primary modules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:sim_architecture}:

    \caption{Simulation framework architecture}
    \label{fig:sim_architecture}
\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Network Topology Generator:} Responsible for creating the network structure including:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Positioning 30 SUs according to a uniform random distribution
        \item Placing the PU and PUEA at specified locations based on the scenario
        \item Implementing the three spatial scenarios described in Chapter 3
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Signal Propagation Model:} Implements the log-normal shadowing model to calculate RSS at each SU:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Applies path loss exponents ranging from 2 to 6
        \item Introduces shadowing effects with standard deviations from 4 to 12 dB
        \item Models transmission power (15 dBm for PU, 35 dBm for PUEA)
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Feature Extraction Module:} Computes the statistical features from RSS measurements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Calculates mean, variance, median, lower quartile, and upper quartile
        \item Performs feature normalization and weighting
        \item Generates feature vectors for each time slot
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Detection Algorithms Module:} Implements both traditional and enhanced detection approaches:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Traditional clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, K-means, Agglomerative, Spectral)
        \item Enhanced detection algorithms (KNN, Means)
        \item Combined two-stage detection framework
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software Implementation}

The simulation framework was implemented using object-oriented programming principles to ensure modularity, extensibility, and code reuse. Key implementation details include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clustering Algorithms:} Utilized MATLAB's Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for implementing K-means, Agglomerative, and Spectral clustering, while DBSCAN was custom-implemented to allow for parameter adaptations
    
    \item \textbf{Visualization:} Employed MATLAB's plotting functions and custom visualization routines to generate network topology diagrams, feature space visualizations, and performance comparison charts
    
    \item \textbf{Statistical Analysis:} Used MATLAB's statistical analysis functions for hypothesis testing and confidence interval calculations
    
    \item \textbf{Parallelization:} Leveraged MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox to expedite simulations across multiple parameter combinations
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset Generation Process}

The dataset for evaluating PUEA detection algorithms was generated through simulation rather than using pre-existing datasets. This approach was chosen to ensure controlled experimental conditions and to systematically vary parameters of interest such as distances, path loss exponents, and PUEA presence percentages.

\subsection{Time Slots Implementation}

The simulation implements a time-slotted system with the following characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Total number of time slots: 100 per simulation run
    \item Fixed time slot duration (conceptually, though not explicitly simulated)
    \item Each time slot contains either a PU transmission or a PUEA transmission (mutual exclusivity)
    \item The presence of PUEA transmissions follows specified percentages (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, or 50\%)
    \item Time slots for PUEA transmission are randomly selected according to the specified percentage
\end{itemize}

For example, in a simulation with 30\% PUEA presence, 30 randomly selected time slots out of the 100 total slots contain PUEA transmissions, while the remaining 70 slots contain legitimate PU transmissions.

\subsection{Random Seed Management}

To ensure reproducibility while also capturing the variability inherent in wireless environments, random seed management was carefully implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A base random seed was established for each experimental configuration
    \item For each replicate of an experiment, the seed was systematically varied
    \item 30 independent simulation runs were performed for each parameter combination to ensure statistical significance
    \item Results were averaged across these runs, and confidence intervals were calculated
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameter Combinations}

The complete parameter space explored in this research includes:

\begin{itemize}
    \item 3 spatial scenarios (Far, Medium, Close distances between PU and PUEA)
    \item 5 path loss exponents (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    \item 5 shadowing standard deviations (4, 6, 8, 10, 12 dB)
    \item 5 PUEA presence percentages (10\%, 20\%, 30\%, 40\%, 50\%)
    \item 4 traditional clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, K-means, Agglomerative, Spectral)
    \item 2 enhanced detection algorithms (KNN, Means)
    \item 30 independent runs per configuration
\end{itemize}

This results in $3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 30 = 67,500$ total simulation runs, where the third factor for algorithms includes the 4 traditional algorithms alone plus the 8 combinations with enhanced approaches.

Due to space constraints, this thesis presents aggregated results and focuses on key parameter combinations that highlight the most significant findings. Complete results are available in the associated digital repository.

\section{Performance Metrics}

To comprehensively evaluate detection performance, multiple complementary metrics were calculated for each algorithm and parameter combination.

\subsection{Detection Rate}

The detection rate (DR), also known as true positive rate or recall, measures the algorithm's ability to correctly identify PUEA transmissions:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Detection Rate} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{TP}$ (True Positives): Number of PUEA transmissions correctly identified as PUEA
    \item $\text{FN}$ (False Negatives): Number of PUEA transmissions incorrectly identified as PU
\end{itemize}

\subsection{False Alarm Rate}

The false alarm rate (FAR) measures the algorithm's tendency to incorrectly classify legitimate PU transmissions as attacks:

\begin{equation}
    \text{False Alarm Rate} = \frac{\text{FP}}{\text{FP} + \text{TN}}
\end{equation}

\noindent where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $\text{FP}$ (False Positives): Number of PU transmissions incorrectly identified as PUEA
    \item $\text{TN}$ (True Negatives): Number of PU transmissions correctly identified as PU
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Precision, Recall, F1-score}

Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
\end{equation}

\noindent Recall is equivalent to the detection rate defined above. The F1-score combines precision and recall into a single metric, providing a balanced measure of detection performance:

\begin{equation}
    \text{F1-score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Accuracy}

Accuracy measures the overall correctness of the algorithm across both classes:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Adjusted Rand Index (ARI)}

The Adjusted Rand Index measures the similarity between the algorithm's clustering and the ground truth clustering, adjusted for chance. It ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect agreement:

\begin{equation}
    \text{ARI} = \frac{\text{RI} - \text{Expected RI}}{\text{Max RI} - \text{Expected RI}}
\end{equation}

where RI is the Rand Index. ARI is particularly useful for evaluating clustering quality independent of the cluster interpretation strategy.

\section{Testing Methodology across Scenarios and PUEA Percentages}

The testing methodology was designed to systematically evaluate algorithm performance across the parameter space while maintaining statistical rigor.

\subsection{Cross-Validation Approach}

To prevent overfitting and ensure robust evaluation, a modified cross-validation approach was implemented:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item For each parameter combination, 30 independent simulation runs were conducted
    \item Parameter optimization (e.g., DBSCAN $\epsilon$, KNN $k$ value) was performed on a subset of 10 runs
    \item Performance evaluation was conducted on the remaining 20 runs
    \item This process was repeated 3 times with different random seeds to ensure stability of results
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Statistical Significance Testing}

Statistical tests were employed to determine the significance of performance differences between algorithms:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Paired t-tests were used when comparing two algorithms across multiple runs
    \item ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey HSD tests were used when comparing multiple algorithms
    \item Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used as non-parametric alternatives when normality assumptions were violated
    \item All tests used a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameter Sensitivity Analysis}

A sensitivity analysis was conducted to understand how algorithm performance varies with different parameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item One-at-a-time parameter variation to isolate effects
    \item Response surface methodology to understand parameter interactions
    \item Identification of optimal parameter combinations for each scenario
\end{itemize}

\section{Visualization Methods}

Various visualization techniques were employed to present the results effectively:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network Topology Diagrams:} TikZ-generated visualizations of the network configuration in each scenario
    
    \item \textbf{Feature Distribution Plots:} Kernel density estimations showing the distribution of each feature for PU and PUEA transmissions
    
    \item \textbf{Clustering Visualizations:} Dimensionality reduction (PCA or t-SNE) to visualize clustering results in two dimensions
    
    \item \textbf{ROC-like Space:} Plots of detection rate versus false alarm rate for different algorithms
    
    \item \textbf{Performance Bar Charts:} Comparative bar charts showing key metrics across algorithms
    
    \item \textbf{Radar Charts:} Multi-dimensional visualization of algorithm performance across multiple metrics
    
    \item \textbf{Heatmaps:} Visualization of performance across different parameter combinations
    
    \item \textbf{Box Plots:} Statistical distribution of performance metrics across multiple runs
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation Challenges and Solutions}

Several challenges were encountered during the experimental implementation, along with their respective solutions:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Computational complexity with large parameter space\\
    \textbf{Solution:} Implemented parallel computing across multiple cores and optimized code for efficiency
    
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Determining optimal parameters for clustering algorithms\\

    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Ensuring fair comparison between algorithms with different characteristics\\
    \textbf{Solution:} Standardized feature preprocessing and used consistent evaluation metrics
    
    \item \textbf{Challenge:} Interpreting clusters for classification without prior knowledge\\
    \textbf{Solution:} Developed the mean RSS-based interpretation strategy that consistently identifies PUEA clusters
\end{itemize}

\section{Reproducibility Considerations}

To ensure reproducibility of the research, several measures were implemented:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Code Repository:} Complete simulation code was documented and stored in a version-controlled repository
    
    \item \textbf{Random Seed Management:} Explicit control and documentation of random seeds for all stochastic processes
    
    \item \textbf{Parameter Documentation:} Detailed recording of all parameter values used in each experiment
    
    \item \textbf{Results Database:} Storage of raw results from all simulation runs in a structured database
    
    \item \textbf{Documentation:} Comprehensive documentation of the simulation framework, algorithms, and analysis methods
\end{itemize}

These measures ensure that other researchers can reproduce the results and build upon this work in future studies.

\section{Performance of Traditional Clustering}

\subsection{Detection Rates across Scenarios}

The detection rates achieved by the four traditional clustering algorithms (DBSCAN, K-means, Agglomerative, and Spectral) were evaluated across the three spatial scenarios. Figure \ref{fig:trad_detection_rates} presents the average detection rates achieved by each algorithm.

            \addplot[fill=blue!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 87.3)
                (B (Medium), 81.2)

            };
            
            \addplot[fill=red!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 88.7)
                (B (Medium), 83.6)
                (C (Close), 72.4)
            };
            
            \addplot[fill=green!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 89.5)

            };
            
            \addplot[fill=orange!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 86.8)
                (B (Medium), 82.5)
                (C (Close), 71.6)

        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Detection rates achieved by traditional clustering algorithms across scenarios}
    \label{fig:trad_detection_rates}
\end{figure}

Several key observations can be made from the detection rate results:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Agglomerative clustering consistently achieved the highest detection rates across all scenarios, with 89.5\%, 84.3\%, and 74.1\% for Scenarios A, B, and C, respectively.
    
    \item K-means performed competitively, achieving the second-best detection rates in all scenarios (88.7\%, 83.6\%, and 72.4\%).
    
    \item All algorithms showed a significant decline in detection performance as the spatial separation between PU and PUEA decreased, with detection rates in Scenario C (Close) dropping by approximately 15-19 percentage points compared to Scenario A (Far).
    
    \item DBSCAN exhibited slightly lower detection rates than K-means and Agglomerative clustering but demonstrated more stable performance across shadowing variations.
    
    \item Spectral clustering showed competitive performance in Scenarios A and B but experienced a more substantial performance drop in Scenario C.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{False Alarm Rates across Scenarios}

The false alarm rates for traditional clustering algorithms are presented in Figure \ref{fig:trad_false_alarm}, showing the complementary aspect of detection performance.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \begin{axis}[

            every node near coord/.append style={font=\footnotesize},
            ]
            
            \addplot[fill=blue!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 5.3)
                (B (Medium), 8.9)

            };
            
            \addplot[fill=red!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 3.8)
                (B (Medium), 7.2)

            \addplot[fill=green!70, draw=black] coordinates {
                (A (Far), 3.2)

        \end{axis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{False alarm rates for traditional clustering algorithms across scenarios}
    \label{fig:trad_false_alarm}
\end{figure}

The false alarm rate results reveal important performance characteristics:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Agglomerative clustering maintained the lowest false alarm rates across all scenarios (3.2\%, 6.7\%, and 12.8\%).
    
    \item All algorithms showed a substantial increase in false alarms as the spatial separation decreased, with rates in Scenario C approximately 3 times higher than in Scenario A.
    
    \item Spectral clustering exhibited the highest false alarm rates in all scenarios, indicating greater sensitivity to noise and overlap in the feature space.
    
    \item The ranking of algorithms by false alarm rate remained consistent across scenarios, with Agglomerative performing best, followed by K-means, DBSCAN, and Spectral clustering.
    
    \item Even the best-performing algorithm (Agglomerative) exhibited a concerning false alarm rate (12.8\%) in the close-proximity scenario, highlighting the challenge of PUEA detection in such conditions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Impact of PUEA Percentage}

The percentage of time slots containing PUEA transmissions significantly influenced detection performance. Figure \ref{fig:puea_percentage_impact} illustrates the impact of varying PUEA presence percentages on the F1-score of the best-performing traditional algorithm (Agglomerative clustering).

\end{figure}

The results demonstrate several important trends:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Detection performance improves as the PUEA presence percentage increases, with the highest F1-scores observed at 50\% PUEA presence across all scenarios.
    
    \item The improvement is most pronounced in the challenging Scenario C, where the F1-score increases from 0.59 at 10\% PUEA presence to 0.79 at 50\% presence.
    
    \item The impact of PUEA percentage is less significant in Scenario A, where the algorithm already achieves good performance even at low PUEA presence.
    
    \item The detection challenge at low PUEA percentages (10-20\%) is particularly severe in Scenario C, with F1-scores below 0.65, indicating poor reliability.

\section{Interpretation of Key Findings}

The experimental results presented in this research provide valuable insights into PUEA detection in cognitive radio networks, particularly regarding the effectiveness of traditional clustering and enhanced detection approaches. Several key findings warrant further discussion and interpretation.

\subsection{Enhanced Detection Performance Gains}

The consistent performance improvements achieved by the enhanced detection approach across all scenarios, algorithms, and metrics represent a significant advancement in PUEA detection capability. These improvements can be attributed to several factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Complementary Strengths:} Traditional clustering algorithms provide global pattern recognition by identifying natural groupings in the feature space, while the refinement algorithms (KNN and Means) leverage local patterns within these clusters. This combination harnesses complementary perspectives on the data, resulting in more accurate classification.
    
    \item \textbf{Decision Boundary Refinement:} Enhanced approaches particularly improve classification near cluster boundaries, where misclassifications are most likely to occur. By analyzing local neighborhoods (KNN) or average distances (Means), the refined approach better handles points in ambiguous regions of the feature space.
    
    \item \textbf{Adaptive Thresholding:} The threshold computation methods used in the enhanced approach adapt to the specific characteristics of each cluster, allowing for more nuanced classification decisions than the binary cluster assignment of traditional methods.
    
    \item \textbf{Error Correction Mechanism:} The two-stage approach effectively functions as an error correction mechanism, where the second stage can identify and rectify potential misclassifications from the first stage.
\end{itemize}

The consistent superiority of KNN over Means as a refinement algorithm suggests that local neighborhood information provides more valuable insights than global distance metrics within clusters. This aligns with the understanding that PUEA detection is fundamentally a local classification problem where nearby points in the feature space are likely to share the same class.

\section{Summary of Research}

This thesis has investigated the detection of Primary User Emulation Attacks (PUEA) in cognitive radio networks, with a particular focus on comparing traditional clustering algorithms with an enhanced, two-stage detection approach. The research systematically evaluated both approaches across varying scenarios of spatial proximity between legitimate and malicious transmitters, different attack intensities, and diverse network conditions.

The traditional clustering algorithms examined—DBSCAN, K-means, Agglomerative, and Spectral clustering—demonstrated reasonable effectiveness in distinguishing between legitimate Primary User (PU) signals and PUEA signals, particularly in scenarios where spatial separation was significant. Each algorithm exhibited distinct strengths: DBSCAN provided robust noise handling, K-means offered computational efficiency, Agglomerative clustering demonstrated flexibility through hierarchical organization, and Spectral clustering excelled in complex feature spaces.

The enhanced detection approach, which combined traditional clustering with KNN or Means algorithms applied within the resulting clusters, consistently outperformed the traditional methods across all experimental conditions. This improvement was particularly pronounced in challenging scenarios where the PUEA transmitter was spatially close to the legitimate PU, with performance gains of up to 14.2\% in detection rate and 12.5\% in F1-score.

Statistical analysis confirmed the significance of these improvements, with p-values well below the standard significance threshold of 0.05 for paired t-tests comparing traditional and enhanced methods. The results demonstrated that the two-stage approach effectively leverages both global patterns (through initial clustering) and local relationships (through the refinement stage), creating a more robust detection framework capable of identifying subtle differences between legitimate and malicious signals.

\section{Limitations of the Study}

While this research has yielded significant insights and advancements, several limitations should be acknowledged:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simulation-Based Evaluation:} The results are based on simulated data rather than measurements from real-world cognitive radio networks, which may not capture all complexities of practical deployment environments.

    \item \textbf{Static Attack Model:} The research assumed a relatively static PUEA strategy rather than adaptive attackers that might modify their behavior in response to detection mechanisms.

    \item \textbf{Computational Complexity:} The enhanced approach, while more accurate, introduces additional computational overhead that may be challenging for resource-constrained cognitive radio devices.

    \item \textbf{Network Scale:} The simulations were conducted at a moderate network scale, and performance at very large scales remains to be fully validated.

    \item \textbf{Feature Selection:} While comprehensive, the feature set used may not exhaustively represent all potentially useful signal characteristics for detection.
    
    \item \textbf{Channel Model Limitations:} The propagation models, while realistic, cannot fully capture all environmental factors that might influence signal characteristics in diverse deployment settings.
\end{itemize}

These limitations present opportunities for future research to build upon and extend the findings presented in this thesis.
